### Introduction

This project provides an action-packed, 2-player fighting game compatibleto run on the BeagleBone Black developed using Qt, and C++. At game start, players can navigate through the game menu, choose their players, and start a new match. Once the battle begins, players
will be able to make their fighter move, punch, kick, block, and jump. After 90 seconds, or once a player's health reaches zero, the game ends and a winner is declared!
